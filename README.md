# ðŸš— Breakpoint: Road Quality & Pothole Detection System

**Passively detect potholes and map road quality using your smartphone's accelerometer.**

---

## Overview

Breakpoint is a system designed to **passively detect potholes and assess road quality** using the accelerometer built into everyday smartphones. As users drive, the application analyzes vibration data in real-time to:

1.  **Classify road segments** by surface condition (e.g., smooth asphalt, rough gravel).
2.  **Automatically identify potholes** based on sudden, characteristic vibration spikes.

This collected data powers a **web-based heatmap visualization**, providing a clear, color-coded overview of real-world road conditions across monitored areas. This serves both drivers seeking smoother routes and infrastructure services needing insight into problematic segments.

Beyond immediate visualization, Breakpoint functions as a **scalable infrastructure tool**. All gathered data is stored for longitudinal analysis and potential integration with:

* Existing navigation applications.
* Road maintenance services for smarter, data-driven repair planning.

In essence, Breakpoint combines real-time driver awareness with crowdsourced infrastructure insights. It's designed to be **lightweight, frictionless, and effective**â€”turning every participating phone into a mobile road quality sensor and every trip into actionable data.
